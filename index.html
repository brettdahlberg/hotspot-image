            <h1>Trees Vary Widely in Pollution Filtering Ability, New Study Shows</h1>

        <p class="main-text">
            We know that plants filter air pollution. That science is well established. What's less well known, though, is which plants are best at filtering which forms of pollution.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            One of the most dangerous forms of urban air pollution is particulate matter: tiny particles of dust suspended in the air. Trees filter some of that dust out of the air, but a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104216305293">new study</a>            out of Beijing shows that some trees are much better at reducing particulate matter concentrations than others.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            In 2013, a National Forest Service study <a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/news/release/urban-trees-clean-air"> found</a> that trees save an average of eight lives every year in New York City. David Nowak, the forest service researcher who
            led that study, said that this new research could "provide a model to cities and towns" seeking to maximize their pollution abatement efforts.

            Despite the smaller size of their leaves (think pine needles), evergreens are better than deciduous trees at filtering air pollution because they keep their leaves year-round, the Chinese researchers found.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
            The team studied a variety of tree species and pollutant types to discern which trees are best at filtering which pollutants. Among their findings: smaller leaves, like pine needles, create vortices that trap some of the smallest particles, and larger
            leaves trap heavier particles like minute flecks of metal in the air.

            Tree choice matters when cities plan strategies to reduce air pollution, said study author Xinli Xia. "They should use the most efficient species," he said, noting that the best choice for a city depends on the particular blend of pollution in its air.
